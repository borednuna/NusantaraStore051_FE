              This website is built using ReactJs on the front-end side. Some
              components are taken from Material UI. The gallery and card
              carousel component uses SwiperJs. The routing between pages is
              managed using react-router.
              <br />
              <br />
              The backend side uses ExpressJs. The database is Postgresql hosted
              by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The server also manages the
              chatting system using Socket.io.
